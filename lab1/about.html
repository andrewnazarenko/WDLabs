            Kazimir Malevich was the founder of the artistic and philosophical school of Suprematism, and his ideas
            about
            forms and meaning in art would eventually constitute the theoretical underpinnings of non-objective, or
            abstract, art. Malevich worked in a variety of styles, but his most important and famous works concentrated
            on
            the exploration of pure geometric forms (squares, triangles, and circles) and their relationships to each
            other
            and within the pictorial space. Because of his contacts in the West, Malevich was able to transmit his ideas
            about painting to his fellow artists in Europe and the United States, thus profoundly influencing the
            evolution
            of modern art.<br>
            <br>
            Malevich worked in a variety of styles, but he is mostly known for his contribution to the formation of a
            true Russian avant-garde post-World War I through his own unique philosophy of perception and painting,
            which he termed Suprematism. <br>
            <br>
            He invented this term because, ultimately, he believed that art should
            transcend subject matter -- the truth of shape and color should reign 'supreme' over the image or narrative.
            More radical than the Cubists or Futurists, at the same time that his Suprematist compositions proclaimed
            that paintings were composed of flat, abstract areas of paint, they also served up powerful and
            multi-layered symbols and mystical feelings of time and space.
            <br>
            <br>Malevich was also a prolific writer. His treatises on the philosophy of art addressed a broad spectrum
            of
            theoretical problems conceiving of a comprehensive abstract art and its ability to lead us to our feelings
            and even to a new spirituality.
